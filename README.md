A mod for **[Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/)** that lets you reduce visual stimulation/visual distractions.  
This mod is mostly intended for people who for one reason or another can't tolerate or don't want "busy" visuals.

# Features

* Hide certain backdrops/stylegrounds, for example to hide all moving snow (hide the Snow and WindSnow backdrops)
* Limit the speed of (or entirely stop) backdrop motion, such as the fast-moving cloud background in Chapter 4
* Lock the background movement (parallax) in place, or lock it to follow the camera movement
* Show a text indicator when there is wind (strength and direction) -- useful if you disable the WindSnow effect
* Tweak or remove effects on death:
  - The wipe/fade to black can be disabled
  - The ring-shaped effect around the player at death can be limited to a single color to remove blinking, or disabled entirely
  - The circular background-warping effect can be disabled
* Hide various other effects:
  - Waterfalls
  - Tentacles -- the purple-ish veil that hides half the screen in parts of chapter 6

**Every setting is configurable**, so it's up to you how to use the mod.

This mod is probably most useful for people prone to motion sickness, highly sensitive persons, and so on.  
Some options might also be useful for speedruns and other types of challenging play, though there are other mods made specifically for such uses (such as Speedrun Tool, CelesteTAS and others).

# Recommended settings

Clearly, this will be extremely individual, but for those wanting to remove distracting effects while keeping the look of the game as close to standard as possible, I find the following useful:

Show Wind Indicator: ON  
Screen Wipes: OFF  
Rotating Death Effect: Remove flashing  
Warping Death Effect: OFF
Max Parallax Speed: 0 (makes the background static in chapters where it moves even when you stand still)  
Parallax During Movement: Follow Camera  
Show Waterfalls: Off (though they are pretty)  
Show Tentacles: Off (makes the game itself easier though, unlike almost every other setting)
Override All Backdrops: No Override  

After that comes a list of all individual backdrops. The ones I've disabled are Snow, Stars BG (first used in chapter 2) and Wind Snow (first used in chapter 4), Final Boss Starfield (used in chapter 6).

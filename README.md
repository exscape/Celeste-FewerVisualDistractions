A **Celeste** mod that lets you reduce the amount of visual distractions/reduce visual stimulation.

The mod can:
* Hide certain backdrops/stylegrounds, for example to hide all moving snow (hide the WindSnow backdrop)
* Limit the speed of (or entirely stop) backdrop motion, such as the fast-moving clouds in Chapter 4
* Show a text indicator when there is wind (strength and direction) -- useful if you disable the WindSnow effect
* Tweak or remove the death effect (the ring-shaped effect around the player at death) -- limit to a single color to remove blinking, or hide it entirely

This mod is probably most useful for people prone to motion sickness, highly sensitive persons, and so on.
Some options might also be useful for speedruns and other types of challenging play.

A mod for **[Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/)** that lets you reduce visual stimulation/visual distractions.
This mod is mostly intended for people who for one reason or another can't tolerate or don't want "busy" visuals.

# Features

* Hide certain backdrops/stylegrounds, for example to hide all moving snow (hide the Snow and WindSnow backdrops)
* Limit the speed of (or entirely stop) backdrop motion, such as the fast-moving cloud background in Chapter 4
* Show a text indicator when there is wind (strength and direction) -- useful if you disable the WindSnow effect
* Tweak or remove effects on death:
  - The wipe/fade to black can be disabled
  - The ring-shaped effect around the player at death can be limited to a single color to remove blinking, or disabled entirely
  - The round background-warping effect can be disabled

This mod is probably most useful for people prone to motion sickness, highly sensitive persons, and so on.
Some options might also be useful for speedruns and other types of challenging play, though there are other mods made specifically for such uses (such as Speedrun Tool, CelesteTAS and others).

# Recommended settings

Clearly, this will be extremely individual, but for those wanting to remove distracting effects while keeping the look of the game as close to standard as possible, I find the following useful:

Show Wind Indicator: ON
Max Parallax Speed: 0 (makes the background static in chapters where it moves even when you stand still)
Screen Wipes: OFF
Rotating Death Effect: Remove flashing
Warping Death Effect: OFF
Override All Backdrops: No Override

After that comes a list of all backdrops. The ones I've disabled are Snow, Stars BG (first used in chapter 2) and Wind Snow (first used in chapter 4).
